# Lecturer-Appointment-xdk-project-University-Utara-Malaysia
The project is aimed to build a soc e-appointment mobile app in order to achieve the effective way to manage students appointment schedule. This app is expected to help the school of computing (soc) students to manage the appointment with their required lecturers quickly.  After gathering the requirements, we have found that students in soc have some difficulties to make the appointment manually and it consume a lot of time and energy to find the required lecturers details (contact and consultation hours) before setup the appointment.  This project development will be guided using agile methodology in order to complete successfully.
